## 🎤 2-Minute Technical Demo

### Introduction (15 seconds)
> "I'm building a quantum wallet that solves the quantum threat to digital payments. When quantum computers arrive, they'll break today's encryption. Our solution: post-quantum cryptography with offline verification."

### Technical Deep Dive (90 seconds)

#### 1. The Problem (20s)
- Show current wallet apps
- "Today's signatures use RSA or ECDSA - quantum computers will break these"
- "We need quantum-resistant algorithms like CRYSTALS-Dilithium"

#### 2. Our Solution (40s)
- **Backend**: "FastAPI server with Merkle trees for transaction integrity"
- **iOS App**: "SwiftUI interface with CryptoKit for quantum signatures"
- **Verification**: "Pure HTML/JavaScript - works offline, no servers needed"

#### 3. Live Demo (30s)
- Create wallet → Send payment → Show receipt → Verify offline
- "Notice the Merkle proof - this proves the transaction is in the block"
- "The signature is quantum-resistant - even future quantum computers can't forge it"

### Technical Highlights (15 seconds)
- **Merkle Trees**: "Cryptographic proofs of transaction inclusion"
- **Block Sealing**: "Transactions batched every 3 payments"
- **Offline Verification**: "Receipts work without internet connection"
- **PQC Ready**: "Architecture supports any post-quantum algorithm"

- **iOS**: SwiftUI with CryptoKit, Ed25519 signatures (PQC-ready)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Merkle trees, block sealing
- **Verifier**: Pure HTML/JS, works offline

### Slide 3: Live Demo (120s)
1. **Create Wallet** (20s)
   - Show key generation
   - "Ed25519 for demo, but architecture supports Dilithium"

2. **Send Payment** (40s)
   - Prepare transaction
   - Sign with quantum-resistant key
   - Submit to backend
   - "Backend builds Merkle tree"

3. **Get Receipt** (30s)
   - Show quantum receipt
   - Point out Merkle proof
   - "This proves transaction inclusion"

4. **Verify Offline** (30s)
   - Open web verifier
   - Paste receipt JSON
   - "✅ Valid - works without internet!"

### Slide 4: Technical Implementation (60s)
- **Merkle Trees**: SHA-256, binary tree structure
- **Block Sealing**: Every 3 transactions or time-based
- **PQC Signatures**: Protocol-based, easily swappable
- **Offline Verification**: Client-side cryptographic validation

### Slide 5: Future Roadmap (30s)
- **Phase 1**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium 3 integration
- **Phase 2**: Hardware security modules
- **Phase 3**: Enterprise compliance features

## 🎭 Demo Tips

### What to Emphasize
1. **Quantum Threat**: Real problem, not theoretical
2. **Offline Verification**: Works without internet
3. **Merkle Proofs**: Cryptographic integrity
4. **PQC Ready**: Architecture supports future algorithms

### What to Show
1. **Key Generation**: "Quantum-resistant keys being created"
2. **Transaction Flow**: "Signed with post-quantum cryptography"
3. **Receipt Details**: "Merkle proof proves inclusion"
4. **Verification**: "Works offline, no servers needed"

### Backup Plans
- **If iOS fails**: Show web verifier with example receipt
- **If backend fails**: Explain architecture with slides
- **If demo fails**: Focus on technical implementation

### Judge Questions & Answers

**Q: "How is this different from Bitcoin?"**
A: "Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures that quantum computers will break. We use post-quantum cryptography that's quantum-resistant."

**Q: "Why not just use existing PQC libraries?"**
A: "We do! Our architecture is PQC-ready. We're using Ed25519 for demo speed, but the same code works with Dilithium."

**Q: "How do you handle key management?"**
A: "Keys are generated client-side, stored securely, and can be backed up. The architecture supports hardware security modules."

**Q: "What about scalability?"**
A: "Merkle trees scale logarithmically. We batch transactions every 3 payments for demo, but this can be optimized."

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
A: "This is a hackathon demo. For production, we'd need security audits, key rotation, and compliance features."
